Ok, so these are for windows, but here is the link for any other OS:

I'll summarize it below for Windows:
	1. Download the folder "backEnd"
	2. Make a file directly in C, "C:\sqlite"
	3. Move all the files from "backEnd" into that new folder "sqlite"
	4. Create an environmental variable that is just "C:\sqlite"
		a. If you don't know how to create environmental variables,
		b. In windows search in the bottom left, type "Environmental Variables"
		c. Click "Edit the system environmental variables"
		d. click Path twice
		e. click "Add new"
		f. write "C:\sqlite"
		g. hit ok, save, get out of all all the environmental variables
	5. type sqlite3 into CMD
	6. you can now use sqlite3 commands, which I'll provide a link for below:
